# tidyrLogo

tidyrLogo is an R script that I wrote to produce a logo for the tidyr package that reflects the spirit of the ackage by spelling out "tidyr" with uniform shapes uniformly colored agains a field of randomly chosen and colored shapes.

tidyr project on CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html

Idealy, the logo would be inscribed in a hexagon in the style of RStudio's genius hexbin stickers, https://www.stickermule.com/user/1070448958/stickers.
